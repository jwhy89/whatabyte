# Create a Simple, Stylish, and Secure Node Express App

In this tutorial series, you'll learn how to create a secure and simple **Node.js** application built with the **Express** web framework. You'll see how **Passport.js with Auth0** is used to manage user authentication and protect routes. On the frontend, you'll use **Pug** templates for rendering views along with **CSS** for maintaining style sheets.

Additionally, you'll learn to streamline your Node.js development workflow by using `nodemon` to restart the server and `browser-sync` to reload the browser whenever relevant source files change.

In this first part, you'll build the foundation for the user interface and API. In the second part, you'll learn how to secure it by adding user authentication.

In this second part, you'll secure the web app by adding user authentication to it using [Passport.js](http://www.passportjs.org/) and [Auth0](https://auth0.com/).
